# Homework 13: Tensor Train Singular Value Decomposition (TTSVD)

## Problem 1 - Implement the TTSVD algorithm for a fourth-order tensor created from a tensor train process using ranks = [3 3 3]. Estimate the original tensor and compare it with its estimation by using the true ranks as input and by using ranks = [2 2 2] as input. Explain the results.

## Problem 2 - Now assuming 1000 Monte Carlo rounds analyze the impact of the reconstruction using the TTSVD under the presence of noisy signals in the SNR range of [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30] dB for the scenario considering the tensor rank to be [3 3 3]. Plot the curve for NMSE vs. SNR for the reconstruction of the original tensor.
