# Homework 12: Tensor Kronecker Product Singular Value Decomposition (TKPSVD)

## Problem 1 - Implement the TKPSVD algorithm for the third-order tensor provided in the files. Estimate the factor matrices by solving the following problem and compare the estimations with the original ones. Explain the results.

## Problem 2 - Now assuming 1000 Monte Carlo rounds analyze the impact of the reconstruction using the TKPSVD under the presence of noisy signals in the SNR range of [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30] dB for the scenario defined by the Kronecker rank of R = 2. Plot the curve for NMSE vs. SNR considering the reconstructed tensor and its matrices.
